## ✨ Features
- 🌍 **City-based weather overview** (temperature, feels-like, humidity, visibility, pressure, UV index, etc.)  
- 📈 **7-day temperature forecast line chart**  
- 🌦 **Weather condition cards** for upcoming days  
- 🌅 **Sunrise & Sunset timings**  
- 🌧 **Rain probability analysis** with bar visualization  
- 🌪 **Air Quality Index (AQI)** including pollutants like CO, NO₂, O₃, SO₂, PM10, PM2.5  
- 📊 **Interactive Power BI visuals** with dynamic cards, charts, and KPIs  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop** – for dashboard creation and data modeling  
- **WeatherAPI.com** – as the weather and air quality data source  
- **Power Query** – for data extraction and transformation  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – for calculated measures and KPIs
